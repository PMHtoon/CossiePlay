<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The goal of CossiePlay is to attract more people into cosplaying especially with the younger generation, high school students and younf adults. Its other goal is to attend cosplay parties which includes cosplay parties organized by CossiePlay or cosplay conventions with costumes made by CossiePlay. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> The success evaluation of the website will be the number of visitors the website gets because the main target is to get more people interested in cosplaying while also getting people to participate in CossiePlay events.
<br>
Another way to evaluate is the number of sign-ups the website gets as it will be proof that the people who visit are also interested in cosplaying and the party Cossie play organises.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Target audience is mainly high school students and young adults.</p>
<p>Since we are in the digital age, a website will be visited more by the target group rather than the older generation. it is also well-organized and have a good navigation system for the users to have a more satisfaction in reading through the content. Some amount of pictures are also added for an easier visualisation of the content by the visitors of the site. </p>
